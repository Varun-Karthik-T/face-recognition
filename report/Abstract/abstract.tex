Despite significant improvement in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Natural
Language Processing, practical Autonomous Driving agents could not be achieved
by governments, multi-million/billion dollar companies or academia. The reason
for this standstill is because of Data-Driven approach of developing Autonomous Driving agents. This work will look at an alternative approach (Knowledge-Driven approach) of developing Autonomous Driving agents using Large Pre-trained Language Models.

This project develops an Autonomous Driving agent with plug and play capabilities with respect to your choice of Large Language Model. This Autonomous Driving agent utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation methodology to overcome fine-tuning requirements which are cost consuming. This work uses Duckietown gym simulation as its 3D environment to operate because of its lightweight requirements and ability to run locally on consumer grade computers. This study comes with a small, high quality dataset with human expert annotations for Autonomous Driverâ€™s actions, reasoning behind the actions and future control signal predictions. Also, This work provides a Dataset collection tool to grow the dataset using community contribution.
